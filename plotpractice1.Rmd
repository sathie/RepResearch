# Read data
```{r}
payments <- read.csv("/home/sarah/Uni/R/RepResearch/payments.csv")
```

#Question 1:
Make a plot that answers the question: What is the relationship between mean covered charges (Average.Covered.Charges) and mean total payments (Average.Total.Payments) in New York?

```{r, message = FALSE}
require(dplyr)
paymentsNY <- filter(payments, Provider.City == "NEW YORK")

require(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(paymentsNY, aes(Average.Covered.Charges, Average.Total.Payments))
p + geom_point(alpha = 0.4, colour = "blue", size = 2) + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, colour = "black", size = 0.5)
```
