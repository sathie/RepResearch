# Read data
```{r}
payments <- read.csv("/home/sarah/Uni/R/RepResearch/payments.csv")
```

#Question 2:
Make a plot (possibly multi-panel) that answers the question: How does the relationship between mean covered charges (Average.Covered.Charges) and mean total payments (Average.Total.Payments) vary by medical condition (DRG.Definition) and the state in which care was received (Provider.State)?

```{r, message = FALSE}
require(ggplot2)
q <- ggplot(payments, aes(log(Average.Covered.Charges), log(Average.Total.Payments)))
q + geom_point(alpha = 0.1, colour = "blue", size = 0.5) + 
  facet_grid(Provider.State ~ DRG.Definition) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, colour = "black", size = 0.5)
```
